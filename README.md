# Virtual lab

The aim of this project is to familiarize the user with vector algebra and relative velocity concepts. The arrows representing velocity of points are green while velocity of point A relative to point B is light blue. The same logic can be applied to acceleraion arrow color scheme. Red for absolute acceleration, orange for relative acceleration.
The slider-crank mechanism was used as an example because of familiarity with an existing physical lab in Sheffield University.

### How to run

- Run this file through your python 3 interpreter.
- Use the buttons to start and stop the simulation. The slider can be used to control the passage of time.
